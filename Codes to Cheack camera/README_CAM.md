# Mono Camera Streaming and Photo Capture

This repository contains two Python scripts for streaming from mono cameras and capturing photos. The setup was tested in two stages:
1. Direct connection to the laptop USB port.
2. Connection via a self-powered USB hub.

**Note: If the script does not work, do not forget to change the camera USB path.**

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV
- numpy

You can install the required packages using:
```sh
pip install opencv-python numpy
